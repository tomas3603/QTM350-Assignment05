## Introduction

- Visualize and detail distributions of global GDP per capitas, Life-Expectancies, and Education Expenditure.
 
  - GDP per capita and life expectancy
  - nation's expenditure on education as a proportion of total GDP.

The data used throughout this study is drawn from World Development Indicators @worldbank2022.

## GDP per capita
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-gdp-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Figure 3: Distribution of GDP per Capita (2022). Source: World Development Indicators."

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(data['gdp_per_capita'], bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Countries')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.show()

```

- Significant disparities in global economic prosperity
- mean GDP per capita is approximately **\$20,345.71**
- standard deviation of **\$31,308.94**
    - indicating substantial variability

## More Key Statistics (GDP per capita):
- **Minimum GDP per Capita:** \$259.03
- **Maximum GDP per Capita:** \$240,862.18
- **Median (50th percentile):** \$7,587.59
- **25th percentile:** \$2,570.56
- **75th percentile:** \$25,982.63

## Life Expectancy
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-life-expectancy-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Figure 4: Distribution of Life Expectancy (2022). Source: World Development Indicators."

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(data['life_expectancy'], bins=20, color='salmon', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Life Expectancy')
plt.xlabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Countries')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.show()

```

## Takeaways
- global average of **72.42 years**
- standard deviation of **7.71 years**
  - moderate variation

## More Key Statistics (Life Expectancy):

- **Minimum Life Expectancy:** 52.997 years
- **Maximum Life Expectancy:** 85.377 years
- **Median (50th percentile):** 73.51 years
- **25th percentile:** 66.78 years
- **75th percentile:** 78.475 years

## GDP and Life Expectancy

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-gdp-life
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1: GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy (2022). Source: World Development Indicators."

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['gdp_per_capita'], data['life_expectancy'], alpha=0.7)
plt.title('GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Takeaways
- positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy
- diminishing returns as GDP per capita increases

## Education Expenditure (% of GDP)
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-education-expenditure-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Figure 5: Distribution of Education Expenditure (% of GDP) (2022). Source: World Development Indicators."

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(data['education_expenditure_gdp_share'].dropna(), bins=15, color='lightgreen', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Education Expenditure (% of GDP)')
plt.xlabel('Education Expenditure (% of GDP)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Countries')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.show()
```

## Takeaways
-mean expenditure is 4.23% of GDP
- standard deviation of 2.07%

## More Key Statistics (Education Expenditure):

- Minimum Education Expenditure: 1.027%
- Maximum Education Expenditure: 16.582%
- Median (50th percentile): 3.887%
- 25th percentile: 2.898%
- 75th percentile: 5.156%

## Top 10 Countries by Education Expenditure (% of GDP) in 2022

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-education-expenditure
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2: Top 10 Countries by Education Expenditure (% of GDP) (2022). Source: World Development Indicators."

# Get top 10 countries
top_10_education = data.nlargest(10, 'education_expenditure_gdp_share')

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(top_10_education['country'], top_10_education['education_expenditure_gdp_share'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Top 10 Countries by Education Expenditure (% of GDP)')
plt.xlabel('Education Expenditure (% of GDP)')
plt.ylabel('Country')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Highest value on top
plt.show()


```

## Revisiting Summary Statistics
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-key-stats
#| tbl-cap: "Table 1: Key Statistics of Selected Indicators."

# Create a DataFrame of key statistics
key_stats = data[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'education_expenditure_gdp_share']].describe().round(2)
print(key_stats)

## McKinsey's Analysis "Pixel's of Progress: Chapter 3"

Our analysis of the relationship between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy** in Figure @fig-gdp-life reveals a positive correlation, indicating that higher economic prosperity generally leads to better health outcomes. However, we also observed diminishing returns at higher GDP levels and significant variability among countries with similar economic standings. This suggests that factors beyond mere economic wealth—such as healthcare infrastructure, education quality, and social policies—play crucial roles in determining life expectancy.

McKinsey Global Institute's "Pixels of Progress: Chapter 3" @mckinsey2023pixels echoes these findings by exploring how advancements in various sectors contribute to human development beyond traditional economic metrics. The article emphasizes that while economic growth is essential, it is not sufficient on its own to ensure improved life expectancy and overall well-being. Investments in **healthcare access**, **education**, and **technological innovation** are highlighted as critical drivers of progress.
